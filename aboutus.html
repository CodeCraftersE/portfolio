                <h5><span>SAYANTAN</span> DAS</h5>
                <p>My name is Sayantan Das, and I am currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at IEM, Kolkata. From the very beginning of my academic journey, I have been deeply passionate about web development, which led me to actively engage in various projects since my first semester. Through these projects, I have acquired a robust skill set that includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, Java, and Python. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical abilities but also ignited my aspiration to become a full-stack web developer.</p>
                
                <p>Now in my second year (third semester), I am more committed than ever to honing my craft and expanding my expertise in web development. I continuously seek out new challenges and learning opportunities to refine my skills and deepen my understanding of both frontend and backend technologies. My journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am excited about the future possibilities as I work towards becoming a well-rounded and proficient full-stack developer.impact. Through collaborative efforts, we are developing a cutting-edge website that will revolutionize how people plan their journeys. Our platform aims to provide users with the most recommended tour plans, ensuring memorable and seamless travel experiences.</p>
